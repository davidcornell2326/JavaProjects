# JavaProjects
These are simple projects I coded in Java during my spare time in my first Computer Science class in high school.

ArrayHelper is a simple helper class to perform common array operations.
CubeMath is a quick math-based game idea I had that prints the game board directly to the command line.
Game2048 is a basic copy of the common game 2048, printing the game board directly to the command line.
PokemonProject is by far the largest project, my own version of a Pokemon battle with different Pokemon
choices with different stats, attacks, types, etc. and a basic opponent AI. It prints the game board and
visual representations of the Pokemon directly to the command line.
Sorter is a simple helper class to sort arrays in different ways.
TicTacToe is a version of the game Tic Tac Toe that prints directly to the command line.
