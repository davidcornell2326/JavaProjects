# JavaProjects
These are simple projects I coded in Java during my spare time in my first Computer Science class in high school.
I did them before I knew basically anything about Java, so for the most part they are each just a single class
with nothing but a main method. However, they show how I was able to work through issues without knowledge of
tools that would trivialize them.

ArrayHelper is a simple helper class to perform common array operations.

CubeMath is a quick math-based game idea I had that prints the game board directly to the command line.

Game2048 is a basic copy of the common game 2048, printing the game board directly to the command line.

PokemonProject is by far the largest project, my own version of a Pokemon battle with different Pokemon
choices with different stats, attacks, types, etc. and a basic opponent AI. It prints the game board and
visual representations of the Pokemon directly to the command line.

Sorter is a simple helper class to sort arrays in different ways.

TicTacToe is a version of the game Tic Tac Toe that prints directly to the command line.
